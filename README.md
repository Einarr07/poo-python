# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**. Objects are instances of **classes**, which allow developers to model real-world entities using attributes (data) and methods (behavior).

Python fully supports OOP principles, making code more **organized**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**.

## Key Concepts of OOP in Python

### 1. Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects will have.

### 2. Objects
An object is an instance of a class. Each object can have its own values for the attributes defined in the class.

### 3. Attributes
Attributes are variables that store data inside a class or object (e.g., `title`, `author`, `price`).

### 4. Methods
Methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object.

### 5. Constructor (`__init__`)
The constructor is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object’s attributes.

### 6. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means grouping data and methods inside a class and controlling access to them.

### 7. Reusability
OOP allows you to reuse classes and extend them, reducing code duplication and improving scalability.

## Example

This project includes a simple example using a `Book` class to demonstrate how OOP works in Python, including:
- Class definition
- Object creation
- Attributes and methods
- Iteration over objects

## Why Use OOP in Python?

- Improves code readability
- Makes projects easier to maintain
- Encourages modular design
- Reflects real-world problem modeling
